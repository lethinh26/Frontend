  <p class="title">5. Groups of selectors</p>
  <p class="content">A comma-separated list of selectors represents the union of all elements selected by each of the individual selectors in the list. (A comma is U+002C.) For example, in CSS when several selectors share the same declarations, they may be grouped into a comma-separated list. White space may appear before and/or after the comma.</p>
  <div class="css">
    <b>CSS example:</b>
    <br><br>

    In this example, we condense three rules with identical declarations into one. Thus, <br><br>
    h1 { font-family: sans-serif }<br>
    h2 { font-family: sans-serif }<br>
    h3 { font-family: sans-serif }<br><br>
    is equivalent to:<br><br>
    h1, h2, h3 { font-family: sans-serif }
